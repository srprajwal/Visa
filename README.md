Abstract - Algorithm analysis and design may be challenging for students majoring in computer science and information science. A number of variables, such as a lack of motivation, a fear of programming, and the abstract nature of programming principles, all contribute to the high dropout and failure rates in basic programming courses. Numerous strategies have been put forth by researchers in an effort to motivate and support students.Despite claims that some of these tools help with the development of programming skills, the problem is still largely unresolved. This study describes ViSA, a tool for visualizing sorting algorithms. ViSA is an easy-to-set-up, fully automatic visualization system. It compares sorting methods and offers detailed directions. The visualization system's design ideas, technical framework, as well as its applications in the real world and educational advantages are shown and discussed.
